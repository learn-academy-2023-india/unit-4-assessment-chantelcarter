# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Similarities

1. JavaScript and Ruby both use many built in methods
2. they both use functions in a similar way, using classes and variables
3. they both use the same/similar data types, along with arrays and objects

Differences

1. the differences between JavaScript and Ruby is the code syntax. with ruby you don't need to worry much about parentheses and curly braces.
2. with Ruby, instead of a "Number" data type, it uses "Floats" and "Integer" data types to differenciate between whole numbers and partial numbers.
3. JavaScript is usually used for front-end development and Ruby is usually used for back-end development

Researched answer:

differences: JavaScript: Multi-paradigm, used for both client-side and server-side development.
Ruby: Object-oriented, known for elegant syntax, and primarily used for general-purpose programming.
JavaScript: Mainly used for client-side scripting and, with Node.js, for server-side development.
Ruby: Commonly used for web development, especially with Ruby on Rails, executed on the server side.

similarities: JavaScript: Embraces object-oriented principles with a focus on objects and classes.
Ruby: Strongly object-oriented, where everything is an object, and classes are fundamental.
JavaScript: Embraces object-oriented principles with a focus on objects and classes.
Ruby: Strongly object-oriented, where everything is an object, and classes are fundamental.

2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: I know that TDD stands for Test Driven Development, so I will assume that a TDD workflow is testing your code when pair programming.

Researched answer: TDD workflow is basically incoperating testing during the development process to make sure that the code is working.

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: a block is a portion of code that can be provided to a method to be executed.

Researched answer: a block serves as a means to consolidate statements and send them as an argument to a method. Frequently linked with iterators, blocks determine the iteration's behavior. They can be declared using either curly braces {} or the do...end keywords.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Answer: a version manager is a software tool that helps developers handle multiple versions of programming language.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms.

1. Database migrations: a database migrationis a file that allows us to make changes to the database schema

2. Model validations: validations are used to make sure that only clean and valid data is saved to the database.

3. Params: short for parameters, are extra pieces of information passed in the URL. the param data can be used by the controller to dynamically change the view.
